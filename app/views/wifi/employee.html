      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Using government Wi-Fi as an employee</h1>

      <p>There are two new shared Wi-Fi systems in government buildings: user.wifi and device.wifi.</p>

      <p><span class="bold-small">user.wifi</span> gives you internet access in all participating buildings. <a href="wifi/guest">Find out how to sign up here.</a></p>

      <p><span class="bold-small">device.wifi</span> gives you access to the internet and also secure networks like <a href="#">PSN (Public Sector Network)</a>. To use it, your device will need to be set up with a certificate by your department's IT team. Once that happens, you'll be able to connect whereever device.wifi is enabled.</p>

      <p>device.wifi is currently in beta in the following buildings:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Aviation House</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <p>If you're using a <span class="bold-small">government owned device</span>, you should contact the support desk who gave it to you.</p>

      <p>If you're using <span class="bold-small">your own device</span>, you should contact the support desk in the building that you're in.</p>

      <p>If you can't get in touch with either of the above teams, email <a href="mailto:support@user.wifi.service.gov.uk">support@user.wifi.service.gov.uk</a> with your location, device model, and what went wrong.</p>
